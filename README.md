## Food Fun in Bengaluru
Bengaluru has a wide and varied mix of restaurant types and cuisines and Bangaloreans deem eating out as an intrinsic part of their culture. Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. This Zomato __[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants)__ aims at analysing different food varieties in different locations.

Analysis includes looking at the restaurant data to see their distribution in different localities, see how rating, average cost and cuisines vary, finding high rated restaurants and localities, popular cuisines in Bengaluru. I also worked on finding an area to invest for a new restaurant using z-scores and also implemented a restaurant finder. Plotting restaurant locations on a map to get a geographic idea about the spread of restaurants in the city.

This analysis will help people understand the average cost, rating, menu, quality of restaurants if they decide an area in which they want to eat food. They will also be able to understand if they can easily find a restaurant to eat under Rs. 350 for two people in a given area. Restaurant finder will list restaurants in the given area, for a given budget and type. Based on reviews, people can pick a good place to enjoy their meal. Restaurant owners can also look at the review analysis to see what their customers feel and work on increasing customer satisfaction.
